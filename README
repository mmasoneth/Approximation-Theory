This repository contains selected exercise solutions and notes from Lloyd N. Trefethen's "Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice" (ATAP), worked during Summer 2025. The material is a non-polished work in progress. 
In addition to exercises and notes, it includes:
    1) A manual implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform
    2) A basic implementation of Chebfun, built using both the Discrete Chebyshev Transform (accelerated with a manual FFT) and the second form of barycentric interpolation.
